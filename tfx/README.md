# TensorFlow Extended (TFX)

* [Building ML pipelines, interactive version](nb_01_interactive_pipeline.ipynb)
    - Original source code from the book "Building Machine Learning Pipelines: Automating Model Life Cycles with TensorFlow", and [corresponding github repository](https://github.com/Building-ML-Pipelines/building-machine-learning-pipelines), authored by Hannes Hapke and Catherine Nelson.
    - I have added annotations and modified the original source code for learning purposes, mainly for more explicitness and exploring further variations on a given topic.
