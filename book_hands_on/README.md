# Source material

* Original source code from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, Second Edition", and [corresponding github repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2), both authored by Aurélien Géron.

* I have modified this source code for learning purposes, mainly for more explicitness and/or exploring further variations on a given topic.

* I have occassionally added Japanese text to share with my Japanese co-workers. 

* I have tried to match the code blocks with corresponding sections in the book. To that end, wrapper functions with matching subtitles and numbering scheme were used. This also helped to eliminate global variables as much as possibe.
